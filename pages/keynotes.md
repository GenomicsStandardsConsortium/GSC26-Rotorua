The ‘Dawn Field Award for Outstanding Contributions to Genomic Standards’ annual award, established in 2022, is to recognize achievements of early-career researchers for their significant contributions to the field of genomic standards. The award honors Dr. Dawn Field (1969-2020) the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC) founder and a pioneer in the field of genomic standards. Nominations are made by GSC Board members. Awardees will present their research at the annual GSC meeting.
